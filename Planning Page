Big Events/Choices
- work or school
  You get an acceptance letter in the mail from a top college! Is it time to quit the old job and go back to school?
  A. Yes! I can't wait to go back and start over! The excitement! The oppotunity! Bring it on! When do I start?
  B. No, going to school will just leave me in debt... And I'm not exactly making a bad living right now.
- get married or single
  You're in your own perfect fairy tale world with the love of your life. Is it time to take your relationship down the aisle and to the next level?
  A. There has never been a more perfect moment and I am confident our love will only grow stronger the closer we are. Not to mention the party...
  B. I'm not sure I'm ready for this... I know that we're in love, but what happens if the road we're walking on gets bumpy later on? I don't want to lose what we have.
- child1/child2
  Your family is the living definition of happily ever after, but does happily ever after include a little bundle of joy? 
  A. It'll be hard rasing a child, but worth it! You can just imagine it, watching your baby girl or boy take his or her first steps towards you...
  B. Raising a child takes resources and attention, more than you have in your schedule! Besides, your family is the perfect size now!
- buy house
  You're walking down the road, on your way to the apartment, when you see a big for sale sign on the house you've had your eye on. Is it time to buy?
  A. Definitely! You've had your eye on it, haven't you? It's perfect, just the right size, and overall, your dream house come true. 
  B. It's so expensive... The rent of your apartment is nothing in comparison. Besides, you don't need a house right now. You need stability and money. 
- buy car
  Your friend invites you to a car show, where you see all the latest models... and one just happens to catch your eye! Buying it's only a signature away...
  A. Sign and drive it away into the horizon! I'm sick of public transportation, with all its waiting and grime! Time for me to get my own ride!
  B. Will it be worth it? Statistically, I know the most travel injuries come from cars... Refueling it will cost more than public transportation, too!
- travel the world
  You're at the doctor's office, waiting and flipping through magazines when you come across an ad for a vacation! Should you put everything behind you and have the journey of your life around the world?
  A. Yes! My job can wait and my family will support me without a doubt! My bags are packed and I'm ready to go! ...Right after this appointment. 
  B. What would your boss say?! It would be a great experience, but you would be missing your family, too. Missing your mom's apple pie and red velvet cake is not worth it. All you ever wanted is at home!
- start own business
  You've had this business idea for years, just simmering in your head. It's now or never. Why not embrace the idea and make millions? What do you have to lose?
  A. Go for it! I have a gut feeling that it won't fail. Time to bring home the big bucks and make myself a name that'll go down in history! I can't wait to be my own boss!
  B. Am I sure it's not just a phase? Where else would all this confidence come out of? If it fails, I'll be bankrupt, and there are plenty of holes in my plan I didn't think through... It's not worth the risk.
