Big Events/Choices
- work or school
  You get an acceptance letter in the mail from a top college! Is it time to quit the old job and go back to school?
  A. Yes! I can't wait to go back and start over! The excitement! The oppotunity! Bring it on! When do I start?
  B. No, going to school will just leave me in debt... And I'm not exactly making a bad living right now.
- get married or single
  You're crazily in love with <insertpersonwithmostinteresthere>. Is it time to take your relationship down the aisle and to the next level?
  A. There has never been a more perfect moment and I am confident our love will only grow stronger the closer we are. Not to mention the party...
  B. I'm not sure I'm ready for this... I know that we're in love, but what happens if the road we're walking on gets bumpy later on? I don't want to lose what we have.
- child1/child2
  Your family is the living definition of happily ever after, but does happily ever after include a little bundle of joy? 
  A. It'll be hard rasing a child, but worth it! You can just imagine it, watching your baby girl or boy take his or her first steps towards you...
  B. Raising a child takes resources and attention, more than you have in your schedule! Besides, your family is the perfect size now!
- buy house
  You're walkingthe road, on your way to the apartment, when you see a big for sale sign on the house you've had your eye on. Is it time to buy?
  A. Definitely! You've had your eye on it, haven't you? It's perfect, just the right size, and overall, your dream house come true. 
  B. It's so expensive... The rent of your apartment is nothing in comparison. Besides, you don't need a house right now. You need stability and money.
